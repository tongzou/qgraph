# README #

QGraph is a graph visualization library, it's still in a very early stage, so documentation is really lacking. What distinguish QGraph from other
graph visualization libraries are:

* Fast initial rendering, able to support thousands of nodes and verticies.
* Able to support rich UI styles.
* Built-in conversion to image
* ...

### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone the repository and do `npm install` to install the dependencies.
* To see it in action, open `test/index.html`.
  * You can drag the canvas to move the graph around.
  * You can use mouse wheel to zoom in/out
  * You can click on a text label to edit it. (The text won't actually change now, just the events are propagating)
  * You can click on the **Save Image** button to save the graph as an image.
* To build the project in case you want to change anything, you can type `yarn build`.

### Who do I talk to? ###
